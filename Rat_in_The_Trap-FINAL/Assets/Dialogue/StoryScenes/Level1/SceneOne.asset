  - text: The name's Meo. I'm one of the residents in this maze.
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: ef71f286f810f9f488286d99fa7d2811, type: 2}

    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 87536d2fdba79844e8a9aadeb4529a9e, type: 2}
  - text: I call it like it is. It's not a room we are in, but a series of irritating
      walls that are too tall to leap over and hundreds of tiresome rooms that make
      it hard to leave.
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: ef71f286f810f9f488286d99fa7d2811, type: 2}
  - text: Well I'm not supposed to be here.

      us. It's your new home.
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: ef71f286f810f9f488286d99fa7d2811, type: 2}
  - text: No, I have a home already. It doesn't make sense. NONE of this makes any
      sense.
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 87536d2fdba79844e8a9aadeb4529a9e, type: 2}
  - text: Yes, indeed. Well I have you the pop talk already and I'll leave you on
      your own for now. Take care and just know that room is the starting point.
      It's easy to get out of here if you answer the questions however they want.
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: ef71f286f810f9f488286d99fa7d2811, type: 2}

  - text: Oh and before I go. I'll be keeping an eye on you. Just cause... you know...
      it's hard to find any new prey these days.

      see nothing, but the rest of a series of corners and walls.]'
