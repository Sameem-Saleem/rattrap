  - text: "Hey stay 5 ft away from me alright. That wasn\u2019t funny at all. Those
      were living animals. Animals I guess I knew somehow. And I know that cat eats
      rats so\u2026 "

  - text: "No I\u2019m not usually like this. I\u2019m not normally fazed by blood,
      but ever since I got here every little thing sets me off. I\u2019m good now
      alright? "

  - text: "[You look at Meo and it didn\u2019t appear that she was lying. In fact,
      you felt the difference between now and in the lab. Maybe it had something
      to do with what was happening in this place.] "

      here? '

  - text: 'Took the shortcut. I was actually trying to warn you about this since
      the shortcut had a much easier exam. '

  - text: 'Right. Well that would have helped a lot. Anyway, are you going to the
      elevator too? '
    speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 87536d2fdba79844e8a9aadeb4529a9e, type: 2}
  - text: 'Yeah. Glimmer told me this was the way out of here. A lot of the previous
      examiners always end up in this elevator to the outside world supposedly. '

  - text: '[You both enter into the elevator. Two buttons appear before you. GROUND
      and LAB were labeled in each button. You click LAB and head together to the
      top of the maze.] '

  - text: While going down you see Miao dripping with saliva. She seems to be holding
      back just enough to not kill you in the elevator.

  - text: (You are about to reach the hallway for the lab, and you sense you need
      to make a run for it. Spam the left and right arrow keys repeatedly. If you
      press anything else, Miao will kill you. If you accidentally click left or
      right twice instead of staggered, she will catch up to you.)
